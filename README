php-router

The Router class is designed to map url's to controller->action methods in your
framework. It is not in itself a framework. To use it, you will need to create
a index/bootstrap file and configure apache to route requests there. Included is
a sample.htaccess file which you can copy into your apache public directory
along with your index/bootstrap file.

The route path is a string specified with no preceding slash and can contain
static and dynamic elements. Dynamic elements are defined with ":" + string
(':dynamic'). They must have corresponding array keys in the args array. The
dynamic args keys can match anything (NULL) or regular expressions.
Static elements are defined without the ":".

Examples
========
url: "/foo/bar/908" will match
this path: 'foo/bar/:id' mapped to array(
        'controller' => 'foo',
        'action'     => 'bar',
        'args'       => array(':id' => NULL)
    )
and will result in foo::bar( array(':id' => 908) )


Basic index.php Example:
=======================
include('Router.php');

try {
    Router::addRoute('foo/bar/:id', array(
        'controller' => 'foo',
        'action'     => 'bar',
        'args'       => array(':id' => NULL)
    ));
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e;
}

Router::mapUrlRequest();

======================

Example using external routes.php file:
======================================
#routes.php must contain only an array stored in a variable, $routes
# and should be in the format:
#$routes = array(
#    'foo/bar/:id' => array(
#        'controller' => 'foo',
#        'action'     => 'bar',
#        'args'       => array(':id' => '/^[0-9]+$/')
#    ),
#    //Catch all map (should go last)
#    ':controller/:action/:id' => array(
#        'controller' => ':controller',
#        'action'     => ':action',
#        'args'       => array(':controller' => NULL, ':action' => NULL, ':id' => NULL)
#    )
#);


include('Router.php');

//Specify the location of the routes.php file
Router::autoLoadRoutes( '/path/to/routes.php' );

Router::mapUrlRequest();
